# K-Mean-Clustering-from-Scratch-without-Libraries
K-mean clustering algorithm on the given dataset when the value for K is user defined, that may be 2, 3, or 4 etc

## What is K-Mean Clustering
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.
## How the K-means algorithm works
To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids
It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:<br>
The centroids have stabilized â€” there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.<br>
The defined number of iterations has been achieved.
